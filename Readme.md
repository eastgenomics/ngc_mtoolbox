# MToolBox is a pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mitochondrial DNA from high throughput sequencing data. (DNAnexus Platform App)

MToolBox includes an updated computational strategy to assemble mitochondrial genomes from Whole Exome and/or Genome Sequencing (PMID: 22669646) and an improved fragment-classify tool (PMID:22139932) for haplogroup assignment, functional and prioritization analysis of mitochondrial variants.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
